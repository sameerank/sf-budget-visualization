## Issues that can be addressed:
- Incorporate negative cash flow data into diagram
- Resize container div so that it does not crop out portions of the interior svg
- Improve resizing so that highly granular data, i.e. the sub-object field, is easier to view
- Use a tooltip to show additional details when hovering over a node or a link
- Use [lifecycle methods for D3.js](http://nicolashery.com/integrating-d3js-visualizations-in-a-react-app/)
